# FAQ

## What does Annie cost?

If you use [our official hosted server](./api.md), it is completely free to use.
If you are [self hosting](./selfhost.md), you will need to pay for hosting if you don't own a server.

## What does your logo mean?

The logo attempts to express Annie's privacy. Even if you aren't a woman, the logo is meant to represent you, because you are fully anonymous to our platform.
(This doesn't include the webmasters, they may be able to track you regardless of if they have Annie or not.)

## Who do I contact for support?

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/annieapp/annie/issues/new/choose), or just email [`support@rdil.rocks`](mailto:support@rdil.rocks).
