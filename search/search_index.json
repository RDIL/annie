This page documents them. Note This page shows the latest documentation for the latest features. Features implemented in later versions then what you may have can be documented here. The official hosted API base is https://api.annieapp.co/ . If you are self hosting , your base will be different, but the commands below should be the same. Common Response \u00b6 All of our JSON endpoints return this at the very least: { \"result\" : { \"fail\" : false } } or if it did fail: { \"result\" : { \"fail\" : true } } This can help for easily determining if something worked or not! New Key \u00b6 To generate a new key, you can visit /keys/new . It will return a JSON payload like this if it worked: { \"result\" : { \"fail\" : false , \"auth\" : { \"key\" : \"somekey\" , \"private-key\" : \"someotherkey\" } } } Warning Keep your generated keys safe, you won't be able to see them again! Delete a Key \u00b6 If you want to erase a key, visit /keys/delete?key=ANNIE_PUBLIC_KEY&private=ANNIE_PRIVATE_KEY . It will return a JSON payload like the common response success if it worked. Warning You can't reverse this once done. Log a \"use\" or \"page visit\" \u00b6 To get Annie to increase the number for 'joins' as they will be called here, you can use the /connect?key=ANNIE_PUBLIC_KEY endpoint. If you don't have a public/private key set to get stats from, see the New Key section above. If all is well, a payload like the common response success will be sent back. Simple as that! Usage Statistics \u00b6 To get how many users Annie has logged join requests for, you can use the /stats.json?key=YOUR_ANNIE_PUBLIC_KEY&private=YOUR_ANNIE_PRIVATE_KEY endpoint. If you don't have a public/private key set to get stats from, see the New Key section above. It should return a payload like this if it worked: { \"result\" : { \"fail\" : false , \"connections\" : \"COUNT\" , \"last-join\" : \"SomeDateAndTime\" } } Note that COUNT will be an integer, but is a string just so docs will show the code block. As for the \"last-join\" element, it will tell you of the most recent join request.","title":"API"},{"location":"api/#api","text":"The Annie API has a whole set of features. This page documents them.

If you would like to help grow Annie, we love your pull requests. They mean a lot to us. Here is some general information you may want to know. Server \u00b6 The Annie backend server runs on Flask . The source code for that can be found in the /server directory. Website \u00b6 The website is split in to 3 different parts. Offical Hosted Backend \u00b6 The official hosted backend (\"OHB\" for short), is our production instance of Annie. It is completely free to use, and the platform we suggest you use. Our hosting provider is PythonAnywhere . Homepage \u00b6 All the pages on the www.annieapp.co domain are hosted on Netlify . The code is located in the /frontend directory. Note The homepage runs on Jekyll . Documentation \u00b6 The documentation you are reading right now is built with MkDocs . The source is in /docs and is hosted by GitHub pages. Dependencies \u00b6 To install all the dependencies you need to run the server, simply open a terminal, change your working directory to the project root, and run this command: $ pip install --upgrade --user -r requirements.txt Warning If you are on Linux or macOS, you may need to add python3 -m to the beginning of the command for it to work. If that doesn't work, try changing pip to pip3 and run that. Development Server Port \u00b6 When the Flask development server is turned on, it runs on the selected IP (port 2000). This can be customized in your config.py . Debugging \u00b6 See Flask's guide on fixing errors. Templates \u00b6 In server/templates/ , you will notice some templates. These are made with Jinja2 , and used by Flask so our HTML is dynamic.","title":"Developer Portal"},{"location":"development/#developer-docs","text":"Welcome developers, Annie is thrilled to have you.
